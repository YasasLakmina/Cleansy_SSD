# Frontend Security Checklist

## ✅ Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers

- ✅ Added CSP headers to `index.html`
- ✅ Configured CSP in `vite.config.js`
- ✅ Created comprehensive CSP configuration in `securityConfig.js`

### 2. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration

- ✅ Updated Vite proxy configuration with proper CORS handling
- ✅ Added security headers to development server
- ✅ Created secure HTTP client with URL validation

### 3. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

- ✅ Added `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header
- ✅ Configured frame protection in Vite server
- ✅ Added meta tag fallback in HTML

### 4. Application Error Disclosure

- ✅ Created secure error handler utility
- ✅ Replaced console.log statements with secure logging
- ✅ Implemented environment-aware error messages

### 5. Private IP Disclosure

- ✅ Removed hardcoded console.log statements
- ✅ Created sanitization utility for sensitive data
- ✅ Added validation for safe URLs

### 6. X-Content-Type-Options Header

- ✅ Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header
- ✅ Configured MIME type protection

### 7. Information Disclosure - Suspicious Comments

- ✅ Removed console.log, console.error, console.warn statements
- ✅ Updated ESLint rules to prevent future console usage
- ✅ Added production build optimizations

### 8. Modern Web Application Security

- ✅ Updated Vite configuration with security headers
- ✅ Added build-time console log removal
- ✅ Configured secure development server

## 🛠️ Security Utilities Created

### 1. Error Handler (`src/utils/errorHandler.js`)

- Secure logging that only works in development
- Environment-aware error messages
- Data sanitization for sensitive information

### 2. Security Config (`src/utils/securityConfig.js`)

- Centralized security settings
- CSP configuration
- Validation patterns and sanitization rules

### 3. Secure HTTP Client (`src/utils/secureHttp.js`)

- URL validation before requests
- Secure headers management
- Built-in error handling

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### 1. Vite Configuration

- Added security headers to development server
- Configured production build optimizations
- Enhanced proxy configuration

### 2. ESLint Configuration

- Added security-focused linting rules
- Prevents console usage in production
- Enforces React security best practices

### 3. Package.json Scripts

- Added security linting script
- Created secure build process
- Added audit checking capability

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

### Production Environment

1. Ensure CSP headers are served by your web server
2. Configure HTTPS-only cookies
3. Set up proper CORS origins for production domains
4. Enable security headers at the server level

### Monitoring

1. Monitor for CSP violations
2. Set up error tracking that doesn't expose sensitive data
3. Regular security audits with `npm audit`

## 📋 Regular Maintenance

### Monthly

- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and update CSP policies
- [ ] Check for new console.log statements

### Before Deployment

- [ ] Run `npm run lint:security`
- [ ] Run `npm run build:secure`
- [ ] Verify security headers are working
- [ ] Test CSP policies

## 🔒 Additional Security Measures

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement proper authentication token management
2. Add input validation and sanitization
3. Set up rate limiting on API calls
4. Implement proper session management
5. Add CSRF protection
6. Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

### Security Headers to Consider Adding

- `Strict-Transport-Security` (for HTTPS)
- `Expect-CT` (Certificate Transparency)
- `Feature-Policy` / `Permissions-Policy`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`
